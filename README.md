### How to check HTML test report locally
    Normally the test will generate html report finally, to open the test report in the last run:
      
        npx playwright show-report

    Test output data is under **output**:

        1. sydney-weather.xml - created by API test
        2. post-api-ampolenergy-onboarding-v1-lead-response.json, created by UI test Scenario B

    Test videos or screenshots will be generated and persisted under videos or screenshot folder during the test run.
    They will be cleaned up before rerun the test CLI.

### CI set up, test report & test artifacts archive, test result notification

       1. The run-test-and-notify job will be triggered automatically
       2. Test report will be generated and all test artifacts will be uploaded
       3. Test result notification will be sent to Slack channel automatically
       4. SMS notification will also be sent to mobile phone by Twilio
