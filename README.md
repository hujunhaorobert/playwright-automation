### Playwright Automation Test Framework For Web APP & API Testing


### How to get started
    1. Git clone the repo
   
    2. Go to playwright-automation folder

    3. Install node, npm (or yarn) if not done yet, but not mix using npm or yarn

    4. Install all dependencies by CLI
   
        npm install


### How to run UI test on different browser engine(chromium | webkit | firefox)
  
    1. Run the UI test on chromium
   
       npm run test:chromium
  
    2. Run the UI test on webkit
   
       npm run test:webkit

    3. Run the UI test on firefox
   
       npm run test:firefox

### How to run API test

    npm run test:api

### How to run all test cases
   
    npm run test:all  

    
### How to check HTML test report locally
    Normally the test will generate html report finally, to open the test report in the last run:
      
        npx playwright show-report

    Test output data is under **output**:

        1. sydney-weather.xml - created by API test
        2. post-api-ampolenergy-onboarding-v1-lead-response.json, created by UI test Scenario B

    Test videos or screenshots will be generated and persisted under videos or screenshot folder during the test run. They will be cleaned up before rerun the test CLI.

### CI/CD set up
    CirculeCI has been enabled for this Github project. Once a new git commit is pushed and merged to main branch:

       1. The run-test job will be triggered
       2. Test report will be generated and all test artifacts will be uploaded to S3.
       3. Test result notification will be sent to Slack channel automatically.
