### How to run API test

    npm run test:api

### How to run all test cases

### How to check HTML test report locally
    Normally the test will generate html report finally, to open the test report in the last run:
      
        npx playwright show-report

    Test output data is stored under output:

        1. sydney-weather.xml - created by API test
        2. post-api-ampolenergy-onboarding-v1-lead-response.json, created by UI test Scenario B

    Test videos or screenshots will be generated and persisted under videos or screenshot folder during the test run.
    These data will be cleaned up beforehand when rerun the test(s) via above CLIs.

### CI Pipeline, test report & test artifacts archive, test result notification
    CircleCI has been setup for this GitHub project. When a new git commit is pushed and merged, it will trigger workflow:

       1. The run-test-and-notify job will be started automatically
       2. Test report will be generated and all test artifacts will be uploaded
       3. Test result notification will be sent to Slack and mobile phone via SMS
